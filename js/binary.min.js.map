This is developed to simplify the usage of enjoyhint (https://github.com/xbsoftware/enjoyhint)\n *\n *  How to Implement in a page:\n *  1. Add the button element to the template: <div id=\"guideBtn\"></div>\n *  2. Add the js initialization call, having the customized parameters: Guide.init({script : 'trading'});\n *  3. Add the script data to getScript() method\n */\n\nvar Guide = function () {\n    var opt = void 0,\n        cookie_name = void 0,\n        btn_next = void 0,\n        btn_finish = void 0;\n\n    var init = function init(options) {\n        opt = {\n            script: '', // the script name in scripts\n            autoStart: false, // false: start by button click\n            guideBtnID: '#guideBtn',\n            btnText: localize('Walkthrough Guide'), // guide start button's text\n            blink_class: 'highlight',\n            blink_inDelay: 1000,\n            blink_outDelay: 1000,\n            blink_interval: 3000, // 0: continous blinking (blink_inDelay + blink_outDelay)\n            blink_count: 0 // 0: infinite\n        };\n        $.extend(true, opt, options);\n\n        cookie_name = 'hide_guide';\n        btn_next = { className: 'button', html: $('<span/>', { text: localize('Next') }) };\n        btn_finish = { className: 'button btnFinish', html: $('<span/>', { text: localize('Finish') }) };\n\n        if ($(opt.guideBtnID).length === 0) {\n            console.warn('Could not find the button placeholder: <div id=\"' + opt.guideBtnID + '\"></div>');\n            return;\n        }\n\n        if (opt.script.length === 0) {\n            console.warn('\"script\" name should be specified');\n            return;\n        }\n\n        if (isDisabled()) {\n            $(opt.guideBtnID).remove();\n            return;\n        }\n\n        makeButton();\n    };\n\n    /*\n     *  do not show the guide button if its close (X) has been clicked before\n     */\n    var isDisabled = function isDisabled() {\n        var disabled = Cookies.get(cookie_name);\n        return !!disabled && $.inArray(opt.script, disabled.split(',')) >= 0;\n    };\n\n    /*\n     *  handle the guide button appearance using a cookie for all scripts\n     */\n    var setDisabled = function setDisabled() {\n        if (!isDisabled()) {\n            var disabled = Cookies.get(cookie_name);\n            Cookies.set(cookie_name, !disabled ? opt.script : disabled + ',' + opt.script);\n        }\n    };\n\n    /*\n     *  generate the button's html\n     */\n    var makeButton = function makeButton() {\n        if ($(opt.guideBtnID).children().length > 0) {\n            return;\n        }\n\n        $(opt.guideBtnID).addClass('gr-hide-m pulser').append($('<span/>', { class: 'close', text: 'X' })).append($('<strong/>'));\n        $(opt.guideBtnID + ' strong').html('<span></span>' + opt.btnText);\n\n        setEvents();\n    };\n\n    /*\n     *  both buttons' click event\n     */\n    var setEvents = function setEvents() {\n        $(opt.guideBtnID + ' strong').click(function () {\n            var enjoyhint_instance = new EnjoyHint({});\n            enjoyhint_instance.setScript(getScript(opt.script));\n            enjoyhint_instance.runScript();\n        });\n\n        if (opt.autoStart) {\n            $(opt.guideBtnID).click();\n        }\n\n        // Hide button\n        $(opt.guideBtnID + ' span.close').click(function () {\n            setDisabled();\n            $(opt.guideBtnID).remove();\n        });\n    };\n\n    /*\n     *  each page's script\n     */\n    var getScript = function getScript(script_name) {\n        if (script_name !== 'trading') {\n            return null;\n        }\n        return [{\n            selector: '#contract_markets',\n            description: '<h1>' + localize('Step') + ' 1</h1>' + localize('Select your market'),\n            event_type: 'next',\n            nextButton: btn_next\n        }, {\n            selector: '#underlying',\n            description: '<h1>' + localize('Step') + ' 2</h1>' + localize('Select your underlying asset'),\n            event_type: 'next',\n            nextButton: btn_next\n        }, {\n            selector: '#contract_form_name_nav',\n            description: '<h1>' + localize('Step') + ' 3</h1>' + localize('Select your trade type'),\n            event_type: 'next',\n            nextButton: btn_next\n        }, {\n            selector: '#websocket_form',\n            description: '<h1>' + localize('Step') + ' 4</h1>' + localize('Adjust trade parameters'),\n            event_type: 'next',\n            nextButton: btn_next\n        }, {\n            selector: '#contracts_list',\n            description: '<h1>' + localize('Step') + ' 5</h1>' + localize('Predict the direction<br />and purchase'),\n            event_type: 'next',\n            nextButton: btn_finish\n        }];\n    };\n\n    return {\n        init: init\n    };\n}();\n\nmodule.exports = Guide;\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 152 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports, __webpack_require__) {\n\n\"use strict\";\n\n\nvar Client = __webpack_require__(3);\nvar CookieStorage = __webpack_require__(5).CookieStorage;\nvar LocalStore = __webpack_require__(5).LocalStore;\nvar Url = __webpack_require__(11);\n\n/*\n * Handles utm parameters/referrer to use on signup\n *\n * Priorities:\n * 1.
