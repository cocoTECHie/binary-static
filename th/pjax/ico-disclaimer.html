to any legal entity which is a qualified investor as defined in the Prospectus Directive;
to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons (other than qualified investors as defined in the Prospectus Directive), as permitted under the Prospectus Directive; or
in any other circumstances falling within Article 3(2) of the Prospectus Directive, provided that no such offer of Tokens shall require the Company to publish a prospectus pursuant to Article 3 of the Prospectus Directive.
For purposes of this provision, the expression an “offer of Tokens to the public” in any relevant member state means the communication in any form and by any means of sufficient information on the terms of the offer and the Tokens to be offered so as to enable an investor to decide to purchase or subscribe for the Tokens, as the expression may be varied in that member state by any measure implementing the Prospectus Directive in that member state.
